# Description: How bash processes command lines
# Usage: ./01.sh


# Bash goes through 5 steps to interpret a command line.

# Step 1: Tokenisation:
# The command line is broken into tokens. Tokens are the smallest units of a command line.
# Tokens are separated by metacharacters, such as spaces, tabs, and newlines, | ; & ( ) < >.
