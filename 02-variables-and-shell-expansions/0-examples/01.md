# Shell Parameters

In shell scripting, understanding and utilizing `parameters` are fundamental for efficient script execution. Parameters serve as placeholders for storing values, controlling script behavior, and interacting with the shell environment.

## What is a Parameter?

A parameter in shell scripting refers to an entity that can store values, allowing manipulation and utilization within scripts. These values are crucial for customizing script behavior and enabling dynamic execution.

## Types of Parameters

Shell scripting has three types of parameters

### 1. Variables

Variables are primary components in shell scripting, facilitating the storage and manipulation of data throughout script execution.

#### a. User-defined Variables

User-defined variables are created by script developers to store custom data. These variables are assigned values using the assignment operator (`=`) and can accommodate diverse data types such as strings, integers, or arrays.

Example:

```bash
name="John"
age=30
```

#### b. Shell Variables

Shell variables are predefined by the shell environment and contribute to controlling shell behavior. These variables are set by the shell itself.

Example:

```bash
echo "Current shell: $SHELL"
echo "Username: $USER"
```

### 2. Positional Parameters

Positional parameters refer to arguments or values supplied to shell scripts or functions during execution. These parameters are accessed within scripts using special notation (`$1`, `$2`, `$3`, etc.), with `$1` representing the first parameter, `$2` the second, and so on. Additionally, `$0` denotes the script or function name.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Script name: $0"
echo "First parameter: $1"
echo "Second parameter: $2"
```

### 3. Special Parameters

Special parameters, predefined by the shell, provide essential information about script execution environment and status.

Commonly used special parameters include:

- `$$`: Current shell process ID (PID).
- `$?`: Exit status of the last command.
- `$#`: Number of positional parameters passed to the script.
- `$@`: Represents all positional parameters as separate quoted strings.
- `$*`: Represents all positional parameters as a single quoted string.

Example:

```bash
#!/bin/bash

echo "Process ID: $$"
echo "Exit status of last command: $?"
echo "Number of parameters: $#"
echo "All parameters as separate strings: $@"
echo "All parameters as a single string: $*"
```

Understanding and effectively utilizing these parameter types empower script developers to create robust and adaptable shell scripts.
