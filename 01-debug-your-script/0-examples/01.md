# Common Error Types in Bash Scripting

When writing Bash scripts, it's common to encounter various types of errors. Understanding these errors and how to address them is crucial for successful script execution. Below are some of the most common error types along with examples and solutions:

## 1. Syntax Errors

Syntax errors occur due to mistakes in the script's syntax, leading to unexpected behavior or failure to execute.

**Example:**

```bash
Syntax Error: unexpected end of file
```

## 2. Not Found Errors

Not found errors occur when the script attempts to access a non-existent file or directory.

**Example:**

```bash
No such file or directory
```

## 3. File Exists Errors

File exists errors occur when the script tries to create a file or directory that already exists.

**Example:**

```bash
File exists
```

## 4. Permission Denied Errors

Permission denied errors arise when the script lacks the necessary permissions for a specific operation.

**Example:**

```bash
Permission denied
```

**Solution:**
This error can often be resolved by using the `sudo` command before the operation that requires elevated permissions.

## 5. Command Not Found Errors

Command not found errors occur when the script attempts to execute a command that is not in the system's PATH.

**Example:**

```bash
Command not found
```

**Solution:**
Ensure that the command is installed on the system or provide the full path to the command in the script.
