# How to Debug Your Bash Script

## Overview

Debugging is the process of identifying and removing errors and/or bugs from a script.
For Bash scripts, one helpful tool for debugging is `shellcheck`.

### Using `shellcheck`

- You can use the browser version of shellcheck at [ShellCheck.net](https://www.shellcheck.net/).
- To install shellcheck, visit the [ShellCheck GitHub repository](https://github.com/koalaman/shellcheck) and follow the instructions.
- It can also be used as a plugin (ShellCheck) for various editors including VS Code.

To run shellcheck from the command line, use the following command:

```bash
shellcheck 1.sh
```

### Limitations of `shellcheck`

- It cannot detect issues with the environment that the script is running in.
- It cannot detect how the permissions are set on the file.
- It won't be able to tell you if specific packages are required to run the script.
