# Introduction to Shells and Shell Scripts

## What is a Shell?

A shell is a fundamental `program` that facilitates interaction between `users` and the `operating system` by interpreting commands. Essentially, it takes commands entered via the keyboard and directs them to the operating system for execution.

In the Linux environment, there are various shells available, with the most prevalent being `bash`â€”an acronym for `Bourne Again SHell`. It serves as the default shell for the majority of Linux distributions.

`NOTE: Please use a bash with a version higher than 4.0.0`

## Understanding Shell Scripts

A shell script is a file that comprises a sequence of commands designed to be executed by the shell. These scripts contribute to the automation of diverse tasks, ranging from system administration to file management and software installation.

## Components of a Shell Script

A typical shell script file consists of three main components:

### 1. Shebang

The shebang, denoted by `#!`, is the initial line in a script that informs the operating system about the interpreter to be used for execution. For instance, `#!/bin/bash` specifies the usage of the Bash shell.

### 2. Commands

The body of the script comprises a series of commands that the shell executes in sequence. These commands can encompass a wide range of operations, allowing users to perform various tasks efficiently.

### 3. Exit Status

Every shell command returns an exit status, indicating whether the command execution was `successful` or `not`. `0` exit code means `successful` and `non 0` exit code means `non successful`

## Significance of Shell Scripts

Shell scripts play a pivotal role in automating tasks, simplifying complex processes, and enhancing system efficiency. Common applications include system administration, repetitive tasks, and the facilitation of software installations.
