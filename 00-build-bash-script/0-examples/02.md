# The `$SHELL` Variable

## Introduction

The `$SHELL` variable in Unix-based and Unix-like operating systems is an environment variable that holds the path to the user's default shell.

## Usage

To access the value stored in the `$SHELL` variable, you can use the `echo` command:

```bash
echo $SHELL
```

This will output the path to the current user's default shell.

## Common Shells

The `$SHELL` variable can point to various shell programs. Some common shells include:

- `/bin/bash`: Bash
- `/bin/zsh` : Zsh
- `/bin/fish`: Fish
- `/bin/dash`: Dash

## Changing the Default Shell

Users can change their default shell using the `chsh` command. This will update the value stored in the `$SHELL` variable:

```bash
chsh -s /bin/zsh
```

This command sets the default shell to Zsh, for example.

## Best Practices

When working with the `$SHELL` variable:

- Ensure compatibility by using the appropriate syntax for the current shell.
- Use the `$SHELL` variable dynamically in scripts to adapt to user's preferences.
- Be cautious when changing the default shell, considering compatibility with existing scripts and configurations.
