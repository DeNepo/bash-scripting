# Setting Up Secure Bash Script Permissions

## Overview

Bash scripts often contain sensitive information and execute commands with potentially significant consequences. By setting up secure permissions, you can prevent unauthorized access, modification, or execution of these scripts, reducing the risk of security breaches or unintended actions.

## Setting Permissions

To set permissions for a Bash script, you can use the `chmod` command to modify the file's mode bits. The mode bits represent three sets of permissions: owner, group, and others.

```bash
chmod <permissions> <script_name>
```

for permissions we can use [Chmod Calculator](https://chmod-calculator.com/)

## Best Practices

Follow these best practices to ensure secure permissions for Bash scripts:

- **Restrict Access**: Limit permissions to only necessary users or groups to minimize the risk of unauthorized access.

- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Assign permissions based on the principle of least privilege, granting only the minimum level of access required for the script's functionality.

- **Regular Review**: Regularly review and update permissions to reflect changes in user roles, access requirements, or security policies.
