# Description: A masterpiece of comments in a bash script.
# Usage: Execute the script and witness the wonder of comments!

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# Behold, the majestic realm of comments!

# Let's start with a single line comment. Riveting, isn't it?

# Now brace yourself for the awe-inspiring multi-line comment. Truly breathtaking.

# Yes, it's still a multi-line comment. You can't escape its magnificence.

# And here's another line, just to make sure you're fully immersed in the comment experience.

echo "Comments in bash script." # Ah, an inline comment. Because why not mix things up?

# But seriously, why isn't the shebang a comment? Let's ponder that existential question.

exit 0

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# How to run the script:
# 1. Summon the terminal from the depths of your operating system.
# 2. Perform the ancient ritual of chmod to grant execute permissions to the script.
# 3. Utter the sacred incantation "./<path-to-the-script>" to invoke the script.
# 4. Observe the output with a sense of wonder and bewilderment.
