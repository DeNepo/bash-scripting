# Description: Demonstrating the echo command with various examples.
# Usage: Just run the script and be amazed by the echo magic!

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# Let's talk about the echo command. It's like talking to yourself in the terminal.

echo "Hello, World! This is the first example." # This echo command is as basic as it gets.

echo -e "Hello,\nWorld! This is the second example." # Whoa, look at that newline character go!

echo -e "Hello,\tWorld! This is the third example." # Tabbing into the world with style.

# Now, let's ponder the deep philosophical question: What is the difference between these echo commands?

exit 0

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# How to run the script:
# 1. Open the terminal
# 2. Find the script file nestled somewhere in your directories
# 3. Try to recall the chmod command and its mysterious numbers
# 4. Execute the script with the perfect combination of dots and slashes
# 5. Marvel at the wonders of echo and question why you're still running this script
