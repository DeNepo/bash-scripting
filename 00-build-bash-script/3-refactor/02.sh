# Description: Demonstrating the usage of the $SHELL variable.
# Usage: Execute the script and marvel at the magic of shell variables!

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# The $SHELL variable holds the path to the current shell. Fascinating, isn't it?

echo "$SHELL" # Let's echo the path to your shell. Exciting stuff, right?

echo "Your default shell is {$SHELL}" # But wait, do we really need those curly braces?

# Question time: Do we actually need double quotes at line 13? Who knows?

# Also, why is $SHELL variable in all uppercase? Is it shouting at us?

# Can you change the default shell? Hmm, let's leave that as an exercise for the reader.

# And hey, are there any other shell variables? Maybe. But that's a mystery for another day.

exit 0

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# How to run the script:
# 1. Open the terminal
# 2. Locate the script file hidden somewhere in your directories
# 3. Try to recall the chmod command syntax and those cryptic numbers
# 4. Execute the script with the usual combination of dots and slashes
# 5. Reflect on the mysteries of shell variables while wondering why you ran this script in the first place
