# Usage: Just run the script and witness the magic!

#-------------------------------------------------------------#

# Wow, so we have some comments here explaining stuff. How exciting!

# The shebang is like the entrance door of this script. It's there because it has to be there. Duh!

# Commands? Yeah, sure. Let's write some. Or maybe not. Let's just skip to the exit status.

# Exit status, the grand finale of our script. Exiting with a status of 0, because why not?

#-------------------------------------------------------------#
exit 0
# How to run the script:
# 1. Open the terminal
# 2. Find the script file buried in your filesystem
# 3. Try to remember the chmod command and what those numbers mean
# 4. Execute the script with the precise combination of dots and slashes
# 5. Wonder why you bothered running it in the first place
